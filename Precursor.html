			<p>The Gold Coast is aptly named for its oppulence, it's full of luxury stores and expensive homes. But it wasn't always this way; in the 1830s William B. Ogden continued to buy land in the Near North Side of Chicago even though the swampy conditions were less than ideal. <br>The Gold Coast is now roughly bounded by North Avenue, Lake Shore Drive, Oak Street, and Clark Street. <br>But it wasn't always this way, a canal had been dug across a bend in the North Branch of the river and later railroad tracks had been constructed all leading to a divide that made the west side a lower income area than the right because of industrial growth in the area. <br>Above is pictured a game of baseball being played in Seward Park in 1909.</p>
