			<!--<p>The place: The Astor Street District. An affluent neighborhood in Chicago's northside. It stretches along the coast of lake Michigan. <br>The area gets its name from a prominent businessman who ironically never lived in the area or even Chicago. </p>-->
			<p>Following the expansion and economic growth of the mid nineteenth century the area prospered and for a time was known as the Astor Street District. The Astor street district was named after a New York businessman by the name of John Jacob Astor. At one point in the early to mid 1800's John Jacob Astor was the richest man in the United States, which left  his last name to remain prestegious and reputable. Although he never lived in the area, or in the city of Chicago at all, the people named this exclusive area after him in attempt to promote wealth, status, and the attraction of others. <br>Pictured above is a street intersection at North Avenue and Astor Street in the early 1900s. </p>
