			<!--<p>The place: The Astor Street District. An affluent neighborhood in Chicago's northside. It stretches along the coast of lake Michigan. <br>The area gets its name from a prominent businessman who ironically never lived in the area or even Chicago. </p>-->
			<p>Following the expansion and economic growth of the mid nineteenth century the area prospered and for a time was known as the Astor Street District. Named after a New York businessman in an attempt to promote the image of wealth and success. <br>Pictured above is a street intersection at North Avenue and Astor Street in the early 1900s.</p>
