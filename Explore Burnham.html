			<p>As the gold coast area became more and more Urban and the trend of high rise buildings and skyscrapers surface, there was much debate to either knock down specific mansions or build on top / extend them. In order to preserve these breathtaking historic monuments. In the late 50â€™s was when the high rise explosion came about which seemed to be cheapening as well as crowing the district. Many people of chicago argued to keep the historic mansions where they were in attempt to preserve them while wealthy businessmen and architects sought opportunity for newer and modern establishments on the lake. Because the National Register of Historic Places provides no protection against private property and private development, many gold coast community residents created districts to protect historic buildings and properties from being touched. Some early preserved districts included the Astor Street of Chicago landmark district and the East Lake shore drive landmark district.</p>
