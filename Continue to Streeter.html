			<p>Captain George Wellington Streeter, who led a career as a Mississippi River steamboat pilot, circus proprietor, and Civil War fighter. It was when he tried to trade in Honduras that he ran in to some trouble. To be precise, a storm caused his ship to crash into a sandbar only 200 yards off the shore of Lake Michigan. His ship was not going anywhere because it was not only stuck up on the sandbar but was also in terrible condition from the storm. </p>
