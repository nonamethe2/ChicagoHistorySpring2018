			<p>Goose island, a small artificial island created when Ogden had built a canal through a portion of the Chicago River's North Branch. It gets its name from the geese that some of the factory workers kept. The island was primarily industrial, although some did live on the island the various pollution from the industries and other businesses on the island kept many away. </p>
