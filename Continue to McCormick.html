			<p>the McCormick's and their reaper works were certainly no trivial force in the business for decades. Having revolutionized the reaping of crops with the invention of the mechanical reaper he set his sights on building his empire building and selling the mechanical reaper. This large piece of land shown above and the other amount of property The McCormicks owned on the Gold Coast goes to show the kind of wealth and sucsesful people  that occupied the area. As for the property that the McCormick's owned in the Gold Coast it had come to be known as McCormickville. <br>Featured above is the McCormick reaper works factory circa 1910, located at Blue Island and Western Avenues. </p>
