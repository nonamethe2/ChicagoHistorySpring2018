			<p>Streeterville is the area surrounding what is now Navy pier; bounded also by the Magnificent Mile and the river. Captain Streeter had laid claim to this land for decades, and he fought for his land to protect it. Mostly from the police that had come to evict him because he had no actualy claim to the land. Streeter was nothing if not persistent. <br>Captain Streeter was always proclaiming that this land was rightfully his and even after his death some still felt his presence. 
			<br><p id="LargeQuoteIndent">"But somehow we can't rid ourselves of the feeling that some night when the fog is rolling in from the lake, we'll walk along the lake shore. Cap Streeter is going to appear out of the shadows, silk hat, frock coat and all, thrust his bayoneted rifle under our noses and shout: 'This is the Deestrict of Lake Michigan. Now git the hell outa here as fast as you can!' And we'll 'git'" (164, Broomell and Harlow)</p>Broomell and Harlow wrote in the Streeterville Saga about one such person who still felt compelled to "git" off of Streeter's land even though he was dead. </p>
