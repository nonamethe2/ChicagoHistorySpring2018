			<p>The District of Lake Michigan is the piece of land that Cap Streeter had essentially made for himself after his ship crashed on a sandbar and he decided it would remain there, his new home. He even managed to expand his territory by encouraging people to dump their garbage in the surrounding area; they even paid him for the privilege to contribute their garbage. </p>
