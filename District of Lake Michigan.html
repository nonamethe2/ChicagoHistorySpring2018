			<p>The District of Lake Michigan is the piece of land that Cap Streeter had essentially made for himself after his ship, the Reutan pictured above, crashed on a sandbar and he decided it would remain there not far off the coast of the Gold Coast District. He even managed to expand his territory by encouraging people to dump their garbage in the surrounding area; they even paid him for the privilege to contribute their garbage. <br>Streeter was very serious about his claim to the District of Lake Michigan. At One of Streeter's many trials regarding his land claim he was very animated, shaking his fists angrily at the soldier. <br>Excerpts from the trial can be found on the subsequent page. </p>
