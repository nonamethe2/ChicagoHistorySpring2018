			<p>The Original playboy mansion was built in 1927 as a hotel and taken over by Hugh Hefner, the influential businessman behind Playboy magazine, and Chicago was where it all began.  Hefner’s mansion stood on 1340 State parkway and still remains now as a slightly renovated building for condominiums. Through 1970-1976, it was a 48 room mansion with all types of gadgets, gizmos, and guests coming in and out. Although 48 rooms, and by the looks of the mansion, one can assume how wealthy one may be and thus the neighborhood. A large mansion like this is Typical in the Gold coast. But, Hugh Hefner himself was influential to the Gold Coast given his mansion in the neighborhood was idolized as the original when his career continued growing. Reporters, journalists, and businessmen came from all over the world to the Gold Coast to see Hugh and his original crib. This made the Gold coast neighborhood even more prestigious and recognized. <br><br>NBC editorial on the Playboy Mansion: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMGi7Y419gA">Link</a>. </p>
